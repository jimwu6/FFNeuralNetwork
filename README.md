# Neural Network Implementation

Implementation of a basic feed-forward neural network written in C++. Only standard libraries are used, and as such a Matrix class was written for matrix operations. 

Dataset is used is the  [banknote authenticatoin dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Rough guide of implementation found [here](http://code-spot.co.za/2009/10/08/15-steps-to-implemented-a-neural-net/).
